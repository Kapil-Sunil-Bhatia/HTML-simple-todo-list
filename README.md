 1stop.ai Internship Project Frontend

## OBJECTIVE : 
The main objective of the Simple HTML Todo List internship project is to create a user-friendly and responsive frontend interface for a simple todo list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to enhance the user experience by providing an intuitive and efficient way to manage tasks.

## INTRODUCTION  :
The Simple HTML Todo List internship project is a frontend development endeavour that aims to build a basic yet functional todo list application. The purpose of this project is to gain practical experience in developing web applications using fundamental frontend technologies. By building a todo list, interns can grasp key concepts like HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality.

## METHODOLOGY :
1.	Requirements Gathering: The project started with understanding the requirements and functionalities of a todo list application. This involved discussions and brainstorming sessions to define the scope and features to be implemented.
2.	UI Design: After gathering the requirements, the team focused on creating an intuitive user interface design. The design aimed to ensure a clean and user-friendly layout, including features like adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, and removing tasks.
3.	HTML Structure: With the UI design in place, the interns proceeded to implement the HTML structure. They utilized semantic HTML elements to build a well-organized and accessible web page.
4.	CSS Styling: To enhance the visual appeal of the todo list, the interns employed CSS to style the HTML elements. The styling included color schemes, typography, layout, and responsiveness for different screen sizes.
5.	JavaScript Functionality: The final phase involved implementing the core functionality of the todo list application using JavaScript. Interns incorporated event handling, DOM manipulation, and local storage to enable task management features like adding, updating, and deleting tasks.

The Project utilises Bootstrap version 5 and fontawesome via folders in the code. The ui consists of a simple table on the mail page. There also is a Add Task Button above the table where we can add a new task. A new popup window appears when user clicks on the add task button. The fields are Task  Description, Task Responsible person and the ETA. User can add the required details and click on the add task button to add it to the table displayed on main page. After that there we see 2 more option of edit and mark as done option for the particular Task. When we click on the edit icon, again the popup appears and we can edit that particular task. When user clicks on mark as done the task is deleted from the list and the table refreshes automatically. The main thing of this project is there is no backend used here. Only html CSS and JavaScript with jQuery and popperjs.
